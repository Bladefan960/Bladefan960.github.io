        My Favorite College
    </h1>

    <center><h2>Reason:</h2></center>

    <p>My favorite college is Mit or Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The reason why this is my favorite college is because it is 
        ranked first in the engineering industry for colleges. It also holds many labs and supplies for the students to use. Not only do they provide technological
        tools for their students to use but every smart student is surrounded by other smart students, therefore increasing the
        chance of learning and success. In addition, they have a very beautiful campus. Although it is a very prestigious school, I believe I can enter through hard work and many coding achievements.

    <center><h2>About MIT:</h2></center>
    
    <img width="350px" height = "250px"class="rounded-circle float-right"src="MITPark.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The mission of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is to advance knowledge and educate students in science, technology, and other areas of scholarship that will best serve the nation and the world in the 21st century. We are also driven to bring knowledge to bear on the worldâ€™s great challenges.
        The Institute is an independent, coeducational, privately endowed university, organized into five Schools (architecture and planning; engineering; humanities, arts, and social sciences; management; and science). It has some 1,000 faculty members, more than 11,000 undergraduate and graduate students, and more than 130,000 living alumni.
        At its founding in 1861, MIT was an educational innovation, a community of hands-on problem solvers in love with fundamental science and eager to make the world a better place. Today, that spirit still guides how we educate students on campus and how we shape new digital learning technologies to make MIT teaching accessible to millions of learners around the world.
