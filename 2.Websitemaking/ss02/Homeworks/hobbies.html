    <p>One of my favorite hobbies are coding. Coding is one of the tools you can use to express your ideas. I really enjoy it because you 
        are able to create something that can be available to the whole world. Using this coding I would like to either create things to help chilren
        learn coding, or work in the machine learning department for google.

    <p>My second favorite hobby is basketball. I shoot around in my backyard almost everyday. I love the planning part of basketball.
        Whenever you step on a court or play one on one, I am always thinking about which way to fake, which way to drive, and which way
        to shoot. I also like to perserverance part of it. Even if you are super tired and sweaty in the middle of the game, you keep playing
        till the end for the hope of victory.

    <p>
        My third favorite hobby is violin. I practice atleast 1 hour every day. I reason this is one of my favorite hobbies because
        it is really soothing if you can create such a beautiful sound after a hard day of school. I also love the feeling when you 
        absolutely DESTROY(By destroy I mean nail it) a hard note in a piece.
