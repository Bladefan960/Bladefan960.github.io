    <h1>My Favorite Movies</h1>
    <h2>1. Avengers: Infinity War</h2>

    <p>
        This is one of my favorite marvel movies. I think it is one of the best because it contains many characters from diffrent movies such as Guardians Of The Galaxy,
        Thor, Spiderman, Black Panther, Winter Soldier, and the original Avengers. I would put more content but no spoilers!

    <h2>2. Earth to Echo</h2>

        Earth to Echo is an awesome movie I think everyone should watch, especially when you are still a kid. It is an action packed movie with many exciting 
        parts that keep your eyes glued to the screen.

    <h2>3. Wall-E</h2>

        There are plenty of great disney movies out there, but Wall-E is my favorite. When I was 6 years old, I remember watching Wall-E with a smile on my face. 
        Everytime I saw robots or new technologies in the movie, I would imagine them and ask questions about them. It was a great childhood pleasure, and I still remember
        today how much fun I had.
